maybe the database isnt running properly? hrm
not getting media in line 82 of rooibos/storage/__init.py
which means that the record is working but the image is not media, it's returning a null...
need to figure out why that is.


maybe need to reset the database? could be that, should try it. yes.

The database is listed as read only. This could be due to a lot of different issues, so 
need to look into which it might be, could just be a chown error, could be a user/password
error. 

might be best to delete DB completely and start over, but that is a shit practice and best 
avoided, for obv reasons.

need to work out why the images arent resizing properly in the create a presentation screen 
and why images arent being downloaded properly in the records (or if they are)

According to the httpd logs one of the main issues is that there is no module named viewers.
this could be an issue with django or with the python installation. if it is with the 
python installation then it is to do with the server update, unfortunately.

presumably installing the correct modules will solve some of the issues.


media is also still getting caught up in random spots. There's some things which work 
and are clearly labelled as MEDIA, but others don't and at the moment I'm not 100%
sure why. May be an issue with imagemagick or something. May be an issue with 
viewers module. Don't think it is the latter, however, or all images would likely
be failing...

- rooibos/presentation/templates/presentation_properties.html is what contains the image, now to figure 
    why the link isnt going to the right place. Not only that though

- for CA - collectiveaccess.py links to MDID_SEARCHER.php which iirc is a script that translates
    the python search to a php script for use in CA - this may be obsolete or broken now, since it
    was made with CA1.3
