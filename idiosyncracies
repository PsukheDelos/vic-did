    Mdid was built with PIL, which is no longer updated -- eventually this will need to be
    updated to use PILLOW, the fork of PIL which is still updated, but for now, the 
    only solution is to specifically install it via easy_install.

    Error: Module named Image does not exist
    short term fix:Uninstall all instances of PIL and install it via easy_install
    long term fix: change all instances of "import Image" to "from PIL import Image"
}

==================================================================================
Mdid is using Django 1.2.3 - current Django version is 1.7, needs to be updated, but 
there are quite a few differences between the two which would need to be fixed, so 
that will be done at a later date, past the proof of concept stage.
==================================================================================
my suggestion to whomever upgrades the django installation is to either:
a) read through all the changelogs on the django website (there's a lot) or,
b) install one version at a time and slowly work your way up, fixing what breaks. 

both are time consuming, but just slamming down 1.7 and trying to fix it from there
w/o reading the changelogs will cause a lot of issues, since the changes start back
as far as 1.5, at LEAST, so possibly earlier

====================================================================================
At the moment rooibos/settings_local.py contains a few key items: it has the API keys 
for some of the databases and a few settings to change the way the system works
if the system is running behing a proxy, you should inform it by changing 
PROXY to True.
DEBUG works in the same way for Debug mode.
MOBILE_ENABLED is for when the mobile extension is fully completed. At the moment
there is a page missing, which causes it to break, thus this setting needs to be False
until that is fixed

Searchers are located in the rooibos/unitedsearch/external module.
Searchers contain some common attributes:
    \STARTLIST{
    - name : name of the searcher*,
    - identifier : the identifier of the searcher*,
    - LOGO_URL : the url of the logo image the searcher uses,
    }
    * - these are required for the searcher to work

To implement a searcher, it is necessary to import it and add its 'name' to searchers.py

To allow advanced search implementation, it is necessary to create a translation dictionary
for the advanced keywords the searcher uses. This dictionary then needs to be added to the list
at rooibos/unitedsearch/external/translators

things to note: 
    \STARTLIST{
    - it is possible to have a searcher with no advanced search functionality, the translator
        compensates for this
    - it is possible to expand the translator language easily, but there needs to be a word 
        equivalent for all searchers. Setting a new word to be just a 'keyword' of some kind
        is a good default
    - 
    }
            
=> TO Run Vic-Did use VIRTUALENV - sourced to ENV folder in /opt/vic-did/ 
    then run "run_workers" which will start the worker script along with Solr

=> To shutdown workers and Solr, just run the script "shutdown_workers" as root. 
    BE AWARE THIS IS NOT PARTICULARLY SAFE - IT WILL CLOSE DOWN ALL PYTHON AND JAVA
        PROCESSES!!! USE WITH CAUTION! 
    an alternative is to kill the processes manually by looking up their ID, this is
    a safer method when the server is rolled out to production, but still not amazing
